            <b>8/25/23</b> - This week I made this website and leared how to upload it to the internet. I learned about the saftey precautions and engineering steps. We tried to roll a marble into a cup. I dont know what I am doing this weekend.

             <b>9/8/23</b> - My week went well. I learned about CAD and designed things. My rube goldberg machine will pop a balloon. The most challenging parts is the construction of the machine.

             <b>9/15/23</b> - This week we finished our project. It took a few tries for it to work successfully but overall it was good. We had multiple different challenges includng the car which would get stuck frequently. But overall it was a good chalenge and was fun.

             <br>
             <b>9/22/23</b> - This week we did multiple challenges. We made a boat. We also cut out E shapes in paper and had to accuratley follow measurments.
             <br>
             <br>
             <b>9/28/23</b> - This week I learned about computer engineering. I learned about components of computers and got to take one apart. It was very informative and I learned alot about how computers fuctions and how the individual parts work together. 
             <br>
                
             <br>
             <b>9/28/23</b> - I learned that there is different types of bioengineering, I also learned that bioengineering is made up of alot of different types of engineering. Our hand project was a very fun project, we were successful in making a prosthetic hand using strings and rubber bands. If I were to make the hand again I would add more fingers.
            <br>
            <b>10/13/23</b> - We learned about aerospace engineering. Four forces on a flying object are weight, life, thrust and drag. This class is very fun!  <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dg0XoXWLx6bd5fkp_gjhs3JBT4UhHizLkVlP34FiE0w/edit#gid=0">BOM</a>

            <b>20/10/23</b> - I learned alot about aerospace engineering this week. I learned about the different types of aerospace engineering and the four forces on a aircraft. My bottle rocket was designed poorly, the wings were backwards and the railing was not attached well.
            <br>
            <b>26/10/23</b> - This week we learned about enviromental engineering and the enviroment. We made water filters that replicate real life water filtration systems.
